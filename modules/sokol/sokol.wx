    sokol_app.h -- cross-platform application wrapper

    Project URL: https://github.com/floooh/sokol

    Do this:
        #define SOKOL_IMPL or
        #define SOKOL_APP_IMPL
    before you include this file in *one* C or C++ file to create the
    implementation.

    In the same place define one of the following to select the 3D-API
    which should be initialized by sokol_app.h (this must also match
    the backend selected for sokol_gfx.h if both are used in the same
    project):

        #define SOKOL_GLCORE33
        #define SOKOL_GLES2
        #define SOKOL_GLES3
        #define SOKOL_D3D11
        #define SOKOL_METAL
        #define SOKOL_WGPU

    Optionally provide the following defines with your own implementations:

        SOKOL_ASSERT(c)     - your own assert macro (default: assert(c))
        SOKOL_LOG(msg)      - your own logging function (default: puts(msg))
        SOKOL_UNREACHABLE() - a guard macro for unreachable code (default: assert(false))
        SOKOL_ABORT()       - called after an unrecoverable error (default: abort())
        SOKOL_WIN32_FORCE_MAIN  - define this on Win32 to use a main() entry point instead of WinMain
        SOKOL_NO_ENTRY      - define this if sokol_app.h shouldn't "hijack" the main() function
        SOKOL_APP_API_DECL  - public function declaration prefix (default: extern)
        SOKOL_API_DECL      - same as SOKOL_APP_API_DECL
        SOKOL_API_IMPL      - public function implementation prefix (default: -)
        SOKOL_CALLOC        - your own calloc function (default: calloc(n, s))
        SOKOL_FREE          - your own free function (default: free(p))

    Optionally define the following to force debug checks and validations
    even in release mode:

        SOKOL_DEBUG         - by default this is defined if _DEBUG is defined

    If sokol_app.h is compiled as a DLL, define the following before
    including the declaration or implementation:

        SOKOL_DLL

    On Windows, SOKOL_DLL will define SOKOL_APP_API_DECL as __declspec(dllexport)
    or __declspec(dllimport) as needed.

    If you use sokol_app.h together with sokol_gfx.h, include both headers
    in the implementation source file, and include sokol_app.h before
    sokol_gfx.h since sokol_app.h will also include the required 3D-API
    headers.

    On Windows, a minimal 'GL header' and function loader is integrated which
    contains just enough of GL for sokol_gfx.h. If you want to use your own
    GL header-generator/loader instead, define SOKOL_WIN32_NO_GL_LOADER
    before including the implementation part of sokol_app.h.

    To make use of the integrated GL loader, simply include the sokol_app.h
    implementation before the sokol_gfx.h implementation.

    For example code, see https://github.com/floooh/sokol-samples/tree/master/sapp

    Portions of the Windows and Linux GL initialization and event code have been
    taken from GLFW (http://www.glfw.org/)

    iOS onscreen keyboard support 'inspired' by libgdx.

    Link with the following system libraries:

    - on macOS with Metal: Cocoa, QuartzCore, Metal, MetalKit
    - on macOS with GL: Cocoa, QuartzCore, OpenGL
    - on iOS with Metal: Foundation, UIKit, Metal, MetalKit
    - on iOS with GL: Foundation, UIKit, OpenGLES, GLKit
    - on Linux: X11, Xi, Xcursor, GL, dl, pthread, m(?)
    - on Android: GLESv3, EGL, log, android
    - on Windows: no action needed, libs are defined in-source via pragma-comment-lib

    On Linux, you also need to use the -pthread compiler and linker option, otherwise weird
    things will happen, see here for details: https://github.com/floooh/sokol/issues/376

    Building for UWP requires a recent Visual Studio toolchain and Windows SDK
    (at least VS2019 and Windows SDK 10.0.19041.0). When the UWP backend is
    selected, the sokol_app.h implementation must be compiled as C++17.

    On macOS and iOS, the implementation must be compiled as Objective-C.

    FEATURE OVERVIEW
    ================
    sokol_app.h provides a minimalistic cross-platform API which
    implements the 'application-wrapper' parts of a 3D application:

    - a common application entry function
    - creates a window and 3D-API context/device with a 'default framebuffer'
    - makes the rendered frame visible
    - provides keyboard-, mouse- and low-level touch-events
    - platforms: MacOS, iOS, HTML5, Win32, Linux, Android (TODO: RaspberryPi)
    - 3D-APIs: Metal, D3D11, GL3.2, GLES2, GLES3, WebGL, WebGL2

    STEP BY STEP
    ============
    --- Add a sokol_main() function to your code which returns a sapp_desc structure
        with initialization parameters and callback function pointers. This
        function is called very early, usually at the start of the
        platform's entry function (e.g. main or WinMain). You should do as
        little as possible here, since the rest of your code might be called
        from another thread (this depends on the platform):

            sapp_desc sokol_main(int argc, char* argv[]) {
                return (sapp_desc) {
                    .width = 640,
                    .height = 480,
                    .init_cb = my_init_func,
                    .frame_cb = my_frame_func,
                    .cleanup_cb = my_cleanup_func,
                    .event_cb = my_event_func,
                    ...
                };
            }

        There are many more setup parameters, but these are the most important.
        For a complete list search for the sapp_desc structure declaration
        below.

        DO NOT call any sokol-app function from inside sokol_main(), since
        sokol-app will not be initialized at this point.

        The .width and .height parameters are the preferred size of the 3D
        rendering canvas. The actual size may differ from this depending on
        platform and other circumstances. Also the canvas size may change at
        any time (for instance when the user resizes the application window,
        or rotates the mobile device).

        All provided function callbacks will be called from the same thread,
        but this may be different from the thread where sokol_main() was called.

        .init_cb (void (*)(void))
            This function is called once after the application window,
            3D rendering context and swap chain have been created. The
            function takes no arguments and has no return value.
        .frame_cb (void (*)(void))
            This is the per-frame callback, which is usually called 60
            times per second. This is where your application would update
            most of its state and perform all rendering.
        .cleanup_cb (void (*)(void))
            The cleanup callback is called once right before the application
            quits.
        .event_cb (void (*)(const sapp_event* event))
            The event callback is mainly for input handling, but is also
            used to communicate other types of events to the application. Keep the
            event_cb struct member zero-initialized if your application doesn't require
            event handling.
        .fail_cb (void (*)(const char* msg))
            The fail callback is called when a fatal error is encountered
            during start which doesn't allow the program to continue.
            Providing a callback here gives you a chance to show an error message
            to the user. The default behaviour is SOKOL_LOG(msg)

        As you can see, those 'standard callbacks' don't have a user_data
        argument, so any data that needs to be preserved between callbacks
        must live in global variables. If keeping state in global variables
        is not an option, there's an alternative set of callbacks with
        an additional user_data pointer argument:

        .user_data (void*)
            The user-data argument for the callbacks below
        .init_userdata_cb (void (*)(void* user_data))
        .frame_userdata_cb (void (*)(void* user_data))
        .cleanup_userdata_cb (void (*)(void* user_data))
        .event_cb (void(*)(const sapp_event* event, void* user_data))
        .fail_cb (void(*)(const char* msg, void* user_data))
            These are the user-data versions of the callback functions. You
            can mix those with the standard callbacks that don't have the
            user_data argument.

        The function sapp_userdata() can be used to query the user_data
        pointer provided in the sapp_desc struct.

        You can also call sapp_query_desc() to get a copy of the
        original sapp_desc structure.

        NOTE that there's also an alternative compile mode where sokol_app.h
        doesn't "hijack" the main() function. Search below for SOKOL_NO_ENTRY.

    --- Implement the initialization callback function (init_cb), this is called
        once after the rendering surface, 3D API and swap chain have been
        initialized by sokol_app. All sokol-app functions can be called
        from inside the initialization callback, the most useful functions
        at this point are:

        int sapp_width(void)
        int sapp_height(void)
            Returns the current width and height of the default framebuffer in pixels,
            this may change from one frame to the next, and it may be different
            from the initial size provided in the sapp_desc struct.

        int sapp_color_format(void)
        int sapp_depth_format(void)
            The color and depth-stencil pixelformats of the default framebuffer,
            as integer values which are compatible with sokol-gfx's
            sg_pixel_format enum (so that they can be plugged directly in places
            where sg_pixel_format is expected). Possible values are:

                23 == SG_PIXELFORMAT_RGBA8
                27 == SG_PIXELFORMAT_BGRA8
                41 == SG_PIXELFORMAT_DEPTH
                42 == SG_PIXELFORMAT_DEPTH_STENCIL

        int sapp_sample_count(void)
            Return the MSAA sample count of the default framebuffer.

        bool sapp_gles2(void)
            Returns true if a GLES2 or WebGL context has been created. This
            is useful when a GLES3/WebGL2 context was requested but is not
            available so that sokol_app.h had to fallback to GLES2/WebGL.

        const void* sapp_metal_get_device(void)
        const void* sapp_metal_get_renderpass_descriptor(void)
        const void* sapp_metal_get_drawable(void)
            If the Metal backend has been selected, these functions return pointers
            to various Metal API objects required for rendering, otherwise
            they return a null pointer. These void pointers are actually
            Objective-C ids converted with a (ARC) __bridge cast so that
            the ids can be tunnel through C code. Also note that the returned
            pointers to the renderpass-descriptor and drawable may change from one
            frame to the next, only the Metal device object is guaranteed to
            stay the same.

        const void* sapp_macos_get_window(void)
            On macOS, get the NSWindow object pointer, otherwise a null pointer.
            Before being used as Objective-C object, the void* must be converted
            back with a (ARC) __bridge cast.

        const void* sapp_ios_get_window(void)
            On iOS, get the UIWindow object pointer, otherwise a null pointer.
            Before being used as Objective-C object, the void* must be converted
            back with a (ARC) __bridge cast.

        const void* sapp_win32_get_hwnd(void)
            On Windows, get the window's HWND, otherwise a null pointer. The
            HWND has been cast to a void pointer in order to be tunneled
            through code which doesn't include Windows.h.

        const void* sapp_d3d11_get_device(void)
        const void* sapp_d3d11_get_device_context(void)
        const void* sapp_d3d11_get_render_target_view(void)
        const void* sapp_d3d11_get_depth_stencil_view(void)
            Similar to the sapp_metal_* functions, the sapp_d3d11_* functions
            return pointers to D3D11 API objects required for rendering,
            only if the D3D11 backend has been selected. Otherwise they
            return a null pointer. Note that the returned pointers to the
            render-target-view and depth-stencil-view may change from one
            frame to the next!

        const void* sapp_wgpu_get_device(void)
        const void* sapp_wgpu_get_render_view(void)
        const void* sapp_wgpu_get_resolve_view(void)
        const void* sapp_wgpu_get_depth_stencil_view(void)
            These are the WebGPU-specific functions to get the WebGPU
            objects and values required for rendering. If sokol_app.h
            is not compiled with SOKOL_WGPU, these functions return null.

        const void* sapp_android_get_native_activity(void);
            On Android, get the native activity ANativeActivity pointer, otherwise
            a null pointer.

    --- Implement the frame-callback function, this function will be called
        on the same thread as the init callback, but might be on a different
        thread than the sokol_main() function. Note that the size of
        the rendering framebuffer might have changed since the frame callback
        was called last. Call the functions sapp_width() and sapp_height()
        each frame to get the current size.

    --- Optionally implement the event-callback to handle input events.
        sokol-app provides the following type of input events:
            - a 'virtual key' was pressed down or released
            - a single text character was entered (provided as UTF-32 code point)
            - a mouse button was pressed down or released (left, right, middle)
            - mouse-wheel or 2D scrolling events
            - the mouse was moved
            - the mouse has entered or left the application window boundaries
            - low-level, portable multi-touch events (began, moved, ended, cancelled)
            - the application window was resized, iconified or restored
            - the application was suspended or restored (on mobile platforms)
            - the user or application code has asked to quit the application
            - a string was pasted to the system clipboard

        To explicitly 'consume' an event and prevent that the event is
        forwarded for further handling to the operating system, call
        sapp_consume_event() from inside the event handler (NOTE that
        this behaviour is currently only implemented for some HTML5
        events, support for other platforms and event types will
        be added as needed, please open a github ticket and/or provide
        a PR if needed).

        NOTE: Do *not* call any 3D API rendering functions in the event
        callback function, since the 3D API context may not be active when the
        event callback is called (it may work on some platforms and 3D APIs,
        but not others, and the exact behaviour may change between
        sokol-app versions).

    --- Implement the cleanup-callback function, this is called once
        after the user quits the application (see the section
        "APPLICATION QUIT" for detailed information on quitting
        behaviour, and how to intercept a pending quit - for instance to show a
        "Really Quit?" dialog box). Note that the cleanup-callback isn't
        guaranteed to be called on the web and mobile platforms.

    MOUSE LOCK (AKA POINTER LOCK, AKA MOUSE CAPTURE)
    ================================================
    In normal mouse mode, no mouse movement events are reported when the
    mouse leaves the windows client area or hits the screen border (whether
    it's one or the other depends on the platform), and the mouse move events
    (SAPP_EVENTTYPE_MOUSE_MOVE) contain absolute mouse positions in
    framebuffer pixels in the sapp_event items mouse_x and mouse_y, and
    relative movement in framebuffer pixels in the sapp_event items mouse_dx
    and mouse_dy.

    To get continuous mouse movement (also when the mouse leaves the window
    client area or hits the screen border), activate mouse-lock mode
    by calling:

        sapp_lock_mouse(true)

    When mouse lock is activated, the mouse pointer is hidden, the
    reported absolute mouse position (sapp_event.mouse_x/y) appears
    frozen, and the relative mouse movement in sapp_event.mouse_dx/dy
    no longer has a direct relation to framebuffer pixels but instead
    uses "raw mouse input" (what "raw mouse input" exactly means also
    differs by platform).

    To deactivate mouse lock and return to normal mouse mode, call

        sapp_lock_mouse(false)

    And finally, to check if mouse lock is currently active, call

        if (sapp_mouse_locked()) { ... }

    On native platforms, the sapp_lock_mouse() and sapp_mouse_locked()
    functions work as expected (mouse lock is activated or deactivated
    immediately when sapp_lock_mouse() is called, and sapp_mouse_locked()
    also immediately returns the new state after sapp_lock_mouse()
    is called.

    On the web platform, sapp_lock_mouse() and sapp_mouse_locked() behave
    differently, as dictated by the limitations of the HTML5 Pointer Lock API:

        - sapp_lock_mouse(true) can be called at any time, but it will
          only take effect in a 'short-lived input event handler of a specific
          type', meaning when one of the following events happens:
            - SAPP_EVENTTYPE_MOUSE_DOWN
            - SAPP_EVENTTYPE_MOUSE_UP
            - SAPP_EVENTTYPE_MOUSE_SCROLL
            - SAPP_EVENTYTPE_KEY_UP
            - SAPP_EVENTTYPE_KEY_DOWN
        - The mouse lock/unlock action on the web platform is asynchronous,
          this means that sapp_mouse_locked() won't immediately return
          the new status after calling sapp_lock_mouse(), instead the
          reported status will only change when the pointer lock has actually
          been activated or deactivated in the browser.
        - On the web, mouse lock can be deactivated by the user at any time
          by pressing the Esc key. When this happens, sokol_app.h behaves
          the same as if sapp_lock_mouse(false) is called.

    For things like camera manipulation it's most straightforward to lock
    and unlock the mouse right from the sokol_app.h event handler, for
    instance the following code enters and leaves mouse lock when the
    left mouse button is pressed and released, and then uses the relative
    movement information to manipulate a camera (taken from the
    cgltf-sapp.c sample in the sokol-samples repository
    at https://github.com/floooh/sokol-samples):

        static void input(const sapp_event* ev) {
            switch (ev->type) {
                case SAPP_EVENTTYPE_MOUSE_DOWN:
                    if (ev->mouse_button == SAPP_MOUSEBUTTON_LEFT) {
                        sapp_lock_mouse(true);
                    }
                    break;

                case SAPP_EVENTTYPE_MOUSE_UP:
                    if (ev->mouse_button == SAPP_MOUSEBUTTON_LEFT) {
                        sapp_lock_mouse(false);
                    }
                    break;

                case SAPP_EVENTTYPE_MOUSE_MOVE:
                    if (sapp_mouse_locked()) {
                        cam_orbit(&state.camera, ev->mouse_dx * 0.25f, ev->mouse_dy * 0.25f);
                    }
                    break;

                default:
                    break;
            }
        }

    CLIPBOARD SUPPORT
    =================
    Applications can send and receive UTF-8 encoded text data from and to the
    system clipboard. By default, clipboard support is disabled and
    must be enabled at startup via the following sapp_desc struct
    members:

        sapp_desc.enable_clipboard  - set to true to enable clipboard support
        sapp_desc.clipboard_size    - size of the internal clipboard buffer in bytes

    Enabling the clipboard will dynamically allocate a clipboard buffer
    for UTF-8 encoded text data of the requested size in bytes, the default
    size is 8 KBytes. Strings that don't fit into the clipboard buffer
    (including the terminating zero) will be silently clipped, so it's
    important that you provide a big enough clipboard size for your
    use case.

    To send data to the clipboard, call sapp_set_clipboard_string() with
    a pointer to an UTF-8 encoded, null-terminated C-string.

    NOTE that on the HTML5 platform, sapp_set_clipboard_string() must be
    called from inside a 'short-lived event handler', and there are a few
    other HTML5-specific caveats to workaround. You'll basically have to
    tinker until it works in all browsers :/ (maybe the situation will
    improve when all browsers agree on and implement the new
    HTML5 navigator.clipboard API).

    To get data from the clipboard, check for the SAPP_EVENTTYPE_CLIPBOARD_PASTED
    event in your event handler function, and then call sapp_get_clipboard_string()
    to obtain the pasted UTF-8 encoded text.

    NOTE that behaviour of sapp_get_clipboard_string() is slightly different
    depending on platform:

        - on the HTML5 platform, the internal clipboard buffer will only be updated
          right before the SAPP_EVENTTYPE_CLIPBOARD_PASTED event is sent,
          and sapp_get_clipboard_string() will simply return the current content
          of the clipboard buffer
        - on 'native' platforms, the call to sapp_get_clipboard_string() will
          update the internal clipboard buffer with the most recent data
          from the system clipboard

    Portable code should check for the SAPP_EVENTTYPE_CLIPBOARD_PASTED event,
    and then call sapp_get_clipboard_string() right in the event handler.

    The SAPP_EVENTTYPE_CLIPBOARD_PASTED event will be generated by sokol-app
    as follows:

        - on macOS: when the Cmd+V key is pressed down
        - on HTML5: when the browser sends a 'paste' event to the global 'window' object
        - on all other platforms: when the Ctrl+V key is pressed down

    DRAG AND DROP SUPPORT
    =====================
    PLEASE NOTE: the drag'n'drop feature works differently on WASM/HTML5
    and on the native desktop platforms (Win32, Linux and macOS) because
    of security-related restrictions in the HTML5 drag'n'drop API. The
    WASM/HTML5 specifics are described at the end of this documentation
    section:

    Like clipboard support, drag'n'drop support must be explicitly enabled
    at startup in the sapp_desc struct.

        sapp_desc sokol_main() {
            return (sapp_desc) {
                .enable_dragndrop = true,   // default is false
                ...
            };
        }

    You can also adjust the maximum number of files that are accepted
    in a drop operation, and the maximum path length in bytes if needed:

        sapp_desc sokol_main() {
            return (sapp_desc) {
                .enable_dragndrop = true,               // default is false
                .max_dropped_files = 8,                 // default is 1
                .max_dropped_file_path_length = 8192,   // in bytes, default is 2048
                ...
            };
        }

    When drag'n'drop is enabled, the event callback will be invoked with an
    event of type SAPP_EVENTTYPE_FILES_DROPPED whenever the user drops files on
    the application window.

    After the SAPP_EVENTTYPE_FILES_DROPPED is received, you can query the
    number of dropped files, and their absolute paths by calling separate
    functions:

        void on_event(const sapp_event* ev) {
            if (ev->type == SAPP_EVENTTYPE_FILES_DROPPED) {

                // the mouse position where the drop happened
                float x = ev->mouse_x;
                float y = ev->mouse_y;

                // get the number of files and their paths like this:
                const int num_dropped_files = sapp_get_num_dropped_files();
                for (int i = 0; i < num_dropped_files; i++) {
                    const char* path = sapp_get_dropped_file_path(i);
                    ...
                }
            }
        }

    The returned file paths are UTF-8 encoded strings.

    You can call sapp_get_num_dropped_files() and sapp_get_dropped_file_path()
    anywhere, also outside the event handler callback, but be aware that the
    file path strings will be overwritten with the next drop operation.

    In any case, sapp_get_dropped_file_path() will never return a null pointer,
    instead an empty string "" will be returned if the drag'n'drop feature
    hasn't been enabled, the last drop-operation failed, or the file path index
    is out of range.

    Drag'n'drop caveats:

        - if more files are dropped in a single drop-action
          than sapp_desc.max_dropped_files, the additional
          files will be silently ignored
        - if any of the file paths is longer than
          sapp_desc.max_dropped_file_path_length (in number of bytes, after UTF-8
          encoding) the entire drop operation will be silently ignored (this
          needs some sort of error feedback in the future)
        - no mouse positions are reported while the drag is in
          process, this may change in the future

    Drag'n'drop on HTML5/WASM:

    The HTML5 drag'n'drop API doesn't return file paths, but instead
    black-box 'file objects' which must be used to load the content
    of dropped files. This is the reason why sokol_app.h adds two
    HTML5-specific functions to the drag'n'drop API:

        uint32_t sapp_html5_get_dropped_file_size(int index)
            Returns the size in bytes of a dropped file.

        void sapp_html5_fetch_dropped_file(const sapp_html5_fetch_request* request)
            Asynchronously loads the content of a dropped file into a
            provided memory buffer (which must be big enough to hold
            the file content)

    To start loading the first dropped file after an SAPP_EVENTTYPE_FILES_DROPPED
    event is received:

        sapp_html5_fetch_dropped_file(&(sapp_html5_fetch_request){
            .dropped_file_index = 0,
            .callback = fetch_cb
            .buffer_ptr = buf,
            .buffer_size = buf_size,
            .user_data = ...
        });

    Make sure that the memory pointed to by 'buf' stays valid until the
    callback function is called!

    As result of the asynchronous loading operation (no matter if succeeded or
    failed) the 'fetch_cb' function will be called:

        void fetch_cb(const sapp_html5_fetch_response* response) {
            // IMPORTANT: check if the loading operation actually succeeded:
            if (response->succeeded) {
                // the size of the loaded file:
                const uint32_t num_bytes = response->fetched_size;
                // and the pointer to the data (same as 'buf' in the fetch-call):
                const void* ptr = response->buffer_ptr;
            }
            else {
                // on error check the error code:
                switch (response->error_code) {
                    case SAPP_HTML5_FETCH_ERROR_BUFFER_TOO_SMALL:
                        ...
                        break;
                    case SAPP_HTML5_FETCH_ERROR_OTHER:
                        ...
                        break;
                }
            }
        }

    Check the droptest-sapp example for a real-world example which works
    both on native platforms and the web:

    HIGH-DPI RENDERING
    ==================
    You can set the sapp_desc.high_dpi flag during initialization to request
    a full-resolution framebuffer on HighDPI displays. The default behaviour
    is sapp_desc.high_dpi=false, this means that the application will
    render to a lower-resolution framebuffer on HighDPI displays and the
    rendered content will be upscaled by the window system composer.

    In a HighDPI scenario, you still request the same window size during
    sokol_main(), but the framebuffer sizes returned by sapp_width()
    and sapp_height() will be scaled up according to the DPI scaling
    ratio. You can also get a DPI scaling factor with the function
    sapp_dpi_scale().

    Here's an example on a Mac with Retina display:

    sapp_desc sokol_main() {
        return (sapp_desc) {
            .width = 640,
            .height = 480,
            .high_dpi = true,
            ...
        };
    }

    The functions sapp_width(), sapp_height() and sapp_dpi_scale() will
    return the following values:

    sapp_width      -> 1280
    sapp_height     -> 960
    sapp_dpi_scale  -> 2.0

    If the high_dpi flag is false, or you're not running on a Retina display,
    the values would be:

    sapp_width      -> 640
    sapp_height     -> 480
    sapp_dpi_scale  -> 1.0

    APPLICATION QUIT
    ================
    Without special quit handling, a sokol_app.h application will quit
    'gracefully' when the user clicks the window close-button unless a
    platform's application model prevents this (e.g. on web or mobile).
    'Graceful exit' means that the application-provided cleanup callback will
    be called before the application quits.

    On native desktop platforms sokol_app.h provides more control over the
    application-quit-process. It's possible to initiate a 'programmatic quit'
    from the application code, and a quit initiated by the application user can
    be intercepted (for instance to show a custom dialog box).

    This 'programmatic quit protocol' is implemented trough 3 functions
    and 1 event:

        - sapp_quit(): This function simply quits the application without
          giving the user a chance to intervene. Usually this might
          be called when the user clicks the 'Ok' button in a 'Really Quit?'
          dialog box
        - sapp_request_quit(): Calling sapp_request_quit() will send the
          event SAPP_EVENTTYPE_QUIT_REQUESTED to the applications event handler
          callback, giving the user code a chance to intervene and cancel the
          pending quit process (for instance to show a 'Really Quit?' dialog
          box). If the event handler callback does nothing, the application
          will be quit as usual. To prevent this, call the function
          sapp_cancel_quit() from inside the event handler.
        - sapp_cancel_quit(): Cancels a pending quit request, either initiated
          by the user clicking the window close button, or programmatically
          by calling sapp_request_quit(). The only place where calling this
          function makes sense is from inside the event handler callback when
          the SAPP_EVENTTYPE_QUIT_REQUESTED event has been received.
        - SAPP_EVENTTYPE_QUIT_REQUESTED: this event is sent when the user
          clicks the window's close button or application code calls the
          sapp_request_quit() function. The event handler callback code can handle
          this event by calling sapp_cancel_quit() to cancel the quit.
          If the event is ignored, the application will quit as usual.

    On the web platform, the quit behaviour differs from native platforms,
    because of web-specific restrictions:

    A `programmatic quit` initiated by calling sapp_quit() or
    sapp_request_quit() will work as described above: the cleanup callback is
    called, platform-specific cleanup is performed (on the web
    this means that JS event handlers are unregisters), and then
    the request-animation-loop will be exited. However that's all. The
    web page itself will continue to exist (e.g. it's not possible to
    programmatically close the browser tab).

    On the web it's also not possible to run custom code when the user
    closes a brower tab, so it's not possible to prevent this with a
    fancy custom dialog box.

    Instead the standard "Leave Site?" dialog box can be activated (or
    deactivated) with the following function:

        sapp_html5_ask_leave_site(bool ask);

    The initial state of the associated internal flag can be provided
    at startup via sapp_desc.html5_ask_leave_site.

    This feature should only be used sparingly in critical situations - for
    instance when the user would loose data - since popping up modal dialog
    boxes is considered quite rude in the web world. Note that there's no way
    to customize the content of this dialog box or run any code as a result
    of the user's decision. Also note that the user must have interacted with
    the site before the dialog box will appear. These are all security measures
    to prevent fishing.

    The Dear ImGui HighDPI sample contains example code of how to
    implement a 'Really Quit?' dialog box with Dear ImGui (native desktop
    platforms only), and for showing the hardwired "Leave Site?" dialog box
    when running on the web platform:

        https://floooh.github.io/sokol-html5/wasm/imgui-highdpi-sapp.html

    FULLSCREEN
    ==========
    If the sapp_desc.fullscreen flag is true, sokol-app will try to create
    a fullscreen window on platforms with a 'proper' window system
    (mobile devices will always use fullscreen). The implementation details
    depend on the target platform, in general sokol-app will use a
    'soft approach' which doesn't interfere too much with the platform's
    window system (for instance borderless fullscreen window instead of
    a 'real' fullscreen mode). Such details might change over time
    as sokol-app is adapted for different needs.

    The most important effect of fullscreen mode to keep in mind is that
    the requested canvas width and height will be ignored for the initial
    window size, calling sapp_width() and sapp_height() will instead return
    the resolution of the fullscreen canvas (however the provided size
    might still be used for the non-fullscreen window, in case the user can
    switch back from fullscreen- to windowed-mode).

    To toggle fullscreen mode programmatically, call sapp_toggle_fullscreen().

    To check if the application window is currently in fullscreen mode,
    call sapp_is_fullscreen().

    ONSCREEN KEYBOARD
    =================
    On some platforms which don't provide a physical keyboard, sokol-app
    can display the platform's integrated onscreen keyboard for text
    input. To request that the onscreen keyboard is shown, call

        sapp_show_keyboard(true);

    Likewise, to hide the keyboard call:

        sapp_show_keyboard(false);

    Note that on the web platform, the keyboard can only be shown from
    inside an input handler. On such platforms, sapp_show_keyboard()
    will only work as expected when it is called from inside the
    sokol-app event callback function. When called from other places,
    an internal flag will be set, and the onscreen keyboard will be
    called at the next 'legal' opportunity (when the next input event
    is handled).

    OPTIONAL: DON'T HIJACK main() (#define SOKOL_NO_ENTRY)
    ======================================================
    In its default configuration, sokol_app.h "hijacks" the platform's
    standard main() function. This was done because different platforms
    have different main functions which are not compatible with
    C's main() (for instance WinMain on Windows has completely different
    arguments). However, this "main hijacking" posed a problem for
    usage scenarios like integrating sokol_app.h with other languages than
    C or C++, so an alternative SOKOL_NO_ENTRY mode has been added
    in which the user code provides the platform's main function:

    - define SOKOL_NO_ENTRY before including the sokol_app.h implementation
    - do *not* provide a sokol_main() function
    - instead provide the standard main() function of the platform
    - from the main function, call the function ```sapp_run()``` which
      takes a pointer to an ```sapp_desc``` structure.
    - ```sapp_run()``` takes over control and calls the provided init-, frame-,
      shutdown- and event-callbacks just like in the default model, it
      will only return when the application quits (or not at all on some
      platforms, like emscripten)

    NOTE: SOKOL_NO_ENTRY is currently not supported on Android.

    TEMP NOTE DUMP
    ==============
    - onscreen keyboard support on Android requires Java :(, should we even bother?
    - sapp_desc needs a bool whether to initialize depth-stencil surface
    - GL context initialization needs more control (at least what GL version to initialize)
    - application icon
    - the UPDATE_CURSOR event currently behaves differently between Win32 and OSX
      (Win32 sends the event each frame when the mouse moves and is inside the window
      client area, OSX sends it only once when the mouse enters the client area)
    - the Android implementation calls cleanup_cb() and destroys the egl context in onDestroy
      at the latest but should do it earlier, in onStop, as an app is "killable" after onStop
      on Android Honeycomb and later (it can't be done at the moment as the app may be started
      again after onStop and the sokol lifecycle does not yet handle context teardown/bringup)

#rem
    sokol_gfx.h -- simple 3D API wrapper

    Project URL: https://github.com/floooh/sokol

    Do this:
        #define SOKOL_IMPL or
        #define SOKOL_GFX_IMPL
    before you include this file in *one* C or C++ file to create the
    implementation.

    In the same place define one of the following to select the rendering
    backend:
        #define SOKOL_GLCORE33
        #define SOKOL_GLES2
        #define SOKOL_GLES3
        #define SOKOL_D3D11
        #define SOKOL_METAL
        #define SOKOL_WGPU
        #define SOKOL_DUMMY_BACKEND

    I.e. for the GL 3.3 Core Profile it should look like this:

    #include ...
    #include ...
    #define SOKOL_IMPL
    #define SOKOL_GLCORE33
    #include "sokol_gfx.h"

    The dummy backend replaces the platform-specific backend code with empty
    stub functions. This is useful for writing tests that need to run on the
    command line.

    Optionally provide the following defines with your own implementations:

    SOKOL_ASSERT(c)     - your own assert macro (default: assert(c))
    SOKOL_MALLOC(s)     - your own malloc function (default: malloc(s))
    SOKOL_FREE(p)       - your own free function (default: free(p))
    SOKOL_LOG(msg)      - your own logging function (default: puts(msg))
    SOKOL_UNREACHABLE() - a guard macro for unreachable code (default: assert(false))
    SOKOL_GFX_API_DECL  - public function declaration prefix (default: extern)
    SOKOL_API_DECL      - same as SOKOL_GFX_API_DECL
    SOKOL_API_IMPL      - public function implementation prefix (default: -)
    SOKOL_TRACE_HOOKS   - enable trace hook callbacks (search below for TRACE HOOKS)

    If sokol_gfx.h is compiled as a DLL, define the following before
    including the declaration or implementation:

    SOKOL_DLL

    On Windows, SOKOL_DLL will define SOKOL_GFX_API_DECL as __declspec(dllexport)
    or __declspec(dllimport) as needed.

    If you want to compile without deprecated structs and functions,
    define:

    SOKOL_NO_DEPRECATED

    Optionally define the following to force debug checks and validations
    even in release mode:

    SOKOL_DEBUG         - by default this is defined if _DEBUG is defined

    sokol_gfx DOES NOT:
    ===================
    - create a window or the 3D-API context/device, you must do this
      before sokol_gfx is initialized, and pass any required information
      (like 3D device pointers) to the sokol_gfx initialization call

    - present the rendered frame, how this is done exactly usually depends
      on how the window and 3D-API context/device was created

    - provide a unified shader language, instead 3D-API-specific shader
      source-code or shader-bytecode must be provided

    For complete code examples using the various backend 3D-APIs, see:

        https://github.com/floooh/sokol-samples

    For an optional shader-cross-compile solution, see:

        https://github.com/floooh/sokol-tools/blob/master/docs/sokol-shdc.md


    STEP BY STEP
    ============
    --- to initialize sokol_gfx, after creating a window and a 3D-API
        context/device, call:

            sg_setup(const sg_desc*)

    --- create resource objects (at least buffers, shaders and pipelines,
        and optionally images and passes):

            sg_buffer sg_make_buffer(const sg_buffer_desc*)
            sg_image sg_make_image(const sg_image_desc*)
            sg_shader sg_make_shader(const sg_shader_desc*)
            sg_pipeline sg_make_pipeline(const sg_pipeline_desc*)
            sg_pass sg_make_pass(const sg_pass_desc*)

    --- start rendering to the default frame buffer with:

            sg_begin_default_pass(const sg_pass_action* actions, int width, int height)

    --- or start rendering to an offscreen framebuffer with:

            sg_begin_pass(sg_pass pass, const sg_pass_action* actions)

    --- set the pipeline state for the next draw call with:

            sg_apply_pipeline(sg_pipeline pip)

    --- fill an sg_bindings struct with the resource bindings for the next
        draw call (1..N vertex buffers, 0 or 1 index buffer, 0..N image objects
        to use as textures each on the vertex-shader- and fragment-shader-stage
        and then call

            sg_apply_bindings(const sg_bindings* bindings)

        to update the resource bindings

    --- optionally update shader uniform data with:

            sg_apply_uniforms(sg_shader_stage stage, int ub_index, const void* data, int num_bytes)

    --- kick off a draw call with:

            sg_draw(int base_element, int num_elements, int num_instances)

        In the case of no instancing: num_instances should be set to 1 and base_element/num_elements are
        amounts of vertices. In the case of instancing (meaning num_instances > 1), num elements is the
        number of vertices in one instance, while base_element remains unchanged. base_element is the index
        of the first vertex to begin drawing from.

    --- finish the current rendering pass with:

            sg_end_pass()

    --- when done with the current frame, call

            sg_commit()

    --- at the end of your program, shutdown sokol_gfx with:

            sg_shutdown()

    --- if you need to destroy resources before sg_shutdown(), call:

            sg_destroy_buffer(sg_buffer buf)
            sg_destroy_image(sg_image img)
            sg_destroy_shader(sg_shader shd)
            sg_destroy_pipeline(sg_pipeline pip)
            sg_destroy_pass(sg_pass pass)

    --- to set a new viewport rectangle, call

            sg_apply_viewport(int x, int y, int width, int height, bool origin_top_left)

    --- to set a new scissor rect, call:

            sg_apply_scissor_rect(int x, int y, int width, int height, bool origin_top_left)

        both sg_apply_viewport() and sg_apply_scissor_rect() must be called
        inside a rendering pass

        beginning a pass will reset the viewport to the size of the framebuffer used
        in the new pass,

    --- to update (overwrite) the content of buffer and image resources, call:

            sg_update_buffer(sg_buffer buf, const void* ptr, int num_bytes)
            sg_update_image(sg_image img, const sg_image_content* content)

        Buffers and images to be updated must have been created with
        SG_USAGE_DYNAMIC or SG_USAGE_STREAM

        Only one update per frame is allowed for buffer and image resources.
        The rationale is to have a simple countermeasure to avoid the CPU
        scribbling over data the GPU is currently using, or the CPU having to
        wait for the GPU

        Buffer and image updates can be partial, as long as a rendering
        operation only references the valid (updated) data in the
        buffer or image.

    --- to append a chunk of data to a buffer resource, call:

            int sg_append_buffer(sg_buffer buf, const void* ptr, int num_bytes)

        The difference to sg_update_buffer() is that sg_append_buffer()
        can be called multiple times per frame to append new data to the
        buffer piece by piece, optionally interleaved with draw calls referencing
        the previously written data.

        sg_append_buffer() returns a byte offset to the start of the
        written data, this offset can be assigned to
        sg_bindings.vertex_buffer_offsets[n] or
        sg_bindings.index_buffer_offset

        Code example:

        for (...) {
            const void* data = ...;
            const int num_bytes = ...;
            int offset = sg_append_buffer(buf, data, num_bytes);
            bindings.vertex_buffer_offsets[0] = offset;
            sg_apply_pipeline(pip);
            sg_apply_bindings(&bindings);
            sg_apply_uniforms(...);
            sg_draw(...);
        }

        A buffer to be used with sg_append_buffer() must have been created
        with SG_USAGE_DYNAMIC or SG_USAGE_STREAM.

        If the application appends more data to the buffer then fits into
        the buffer, the buffer will go into the "overflow" state for the
        rest of the frame.

        Any draw calls attempting to render an overflown buffer will be
        silently dropped (in debug mode this will also result in a
        validation error).

        You can also check manually if a buffer is in overflow-state by calling

            bool sg_query_buffer_overflow(sg_buffer buf)

        NOTE: Due to restrictions in underlying 3D-APIs, appended chunks of
        data will be 4-byte aligned in the destination buffer. This means
        that there will be gaps in index buffers containing 16-bit indices
        when the number of indices in a call to sg_append_buffer() is
        odd. This isn't a problem when each call to sg_append_buffer()
        is associated with one draw call, but will be problematic when
        a single indexed draw call spans several appended chunks of indices.

    --- to check at runtime for optional features, limits and pixelformat support,
        call:

            sg_features sg_query_features()
            sg_limits sg_query_limits()
            sg_pixelformat_info sg_query_pixelformat(sg_pixel_format fmt)

    --- if you need to call into the underlying 3D-API directly, you must call:

            sg_reset_state_cache()

        ...before calling sokol_gfx functions again

    --- you can inspect the original sg_desc structure handed to sg_setup()
        by calling sg_query_desc(). This will return an sg_desc struct with
        the default values patched in instead of any zero-initialized values

    --- you can inspect various internal resource attributes via:

            sg_buffer_info sg_query_buffer_info(sg_buffer buf)
            sg_image_info sg_query_image_info(sg_image img)
            sg_shader_info sg_query_shader_info(sg_shader shd)
            sg_pipeline_info sg_query_pipeline_info(sg_pipeline pip)
            sg_pass_info sg_query_pass_info(sg_pass pass)

        ...please note that the returned info-structs are tied quite closely
        to sokol_gfx.h internals, and may change more often than other
        public API functions and structs.

    --- you can ask at runtime what backend sokol_gfx.h has been compiled
        for, or whether the GLES3 backend had to fall back to GLES2 with:

            sg_backend sg_query_backend(void)

    --- you can query the default resource creation parameters through the functions

            sg_buffer_desc sg_query_buffer_defaults(const sg_buffer_desc* desc)
            sg_image_desc sg_query_image_defaults(const sg_image_desc* desc)
            sg_shader_desc sg_query_shader_defaults(const sg_shader_desc* desc)
            sg_pipeline_desc sg_query_pipeline_defaults(const sg_pipeline_desc* desc)
            sg_pass_desc sg_query_pass_defaults(const sg_pass_desc* desc)

        These functions take a pointer to a desc structure which may contain
        zero-initialized items for default values. These zero-init values
        will be replaced with their concrete values in the returned desc
        struct.

    ON INITIALIZATION:
    ==================
    When calling sg_setup(), a pointer to an sg_desc struct must be provided
    which contains initialization options. These options provide two types
    of information to sokol-gfx:

        (1) upper bounds and limits needed to allocate various internal
            data structures:
                - the max number of resources of each type that can
                  be alive at the same time, this is used for allocating
                  internal pools
                - the max overall size of uniform data that can be
                  updated per frame, including a worst-case alignment
                  per uniform update (this worst-case alignment is 256 bytes)
                - the max size of all dynamic resource updates (sg_update_buffer,
                  sg_append_buffer and sg_update_image) per frame
                - the max number of entries in the texture sampler cache
                  (how many unique texture sampler can exist at the same time)
            Not all of those limit values are used by all backends, but it is
            good practice to provide them none-the-less.

        (2) 3D-API "context information" (sometimes also called "bindings"):
            sokol_gfx.h doesn't create or initialize 3D API objects which are
            closely related to the presentation layer (this includes the "rendering
            device", the swapchain, and any objects which depend on the
            swapchain). These API objects (or callback functions to obtain
            them, if those objects might change between frames), must
            be provided in a nested sg_context_desc struct inside the
            sg_desc struct. If sokol_gfx.h is used together with
            sokol_app.h, have a look at the sokol_glue.h header which provides
            a convenience function to get a sg_context_desc struct filled out
            with context information provided by sokol_app.h

    See the documention block of the sg_desc struct below for more information.

    BACKEND-SPECIFIC TOPICS:
    ========================
    --- the GL backends need to know about the internal structure of uniform
        blocks, and the texture sampler-name and -type:

            typedef struct {
                float mvp[16];      // model-view-projection matrix
                float offset0[2];   // some 2D vectors
                float offset1[2];
                float offset2[2];
            } params_t;

            // uniform block structure and texture image definition in sg_shader_desc:
            sg_shader_desc desc = {
                // uniform block description (size and internal structure)
                .vs.uniform_blocks[0] = {
                    .size = sizeof(params_t),
                    .uniforms = {
                        [0] = { .name="mvp", .type=SG_UNIFORMTYPE_MAT4 },
                        [1] = { .name="offset0", .type=SG_UNIFORMTYPE_VEC2 },
                        ...
                    }
                },
                // one texture on the fragment-shader-stage, GLES2/WebGL needs name and image type
                .fs.images[0] = { .name="tex", .type=SG_IMAGETYPE_ARRAY }
                ...
            };

    --- the Metal and D3D11 backends only need to know the size of uniform blocks,
        not their internal member structure, and they only need to know
        the type of a texture sampler, not its name:

            sg_shader_desc desc = {
                .vs.uniform_blocks[0].size = sizeof(params_t),
                .fs.images[0].type = SG_IMAGETYPE_ARRAY,
                ...
            };

    --- when creating a shader object, GLES2/WebGL need to know the vertex
        attribute names as used in the vertex shader:

            sg_shader_desc desc = {
                .attrs = {
                    [0] = { .name="position" },
                    [1] = { .name="color1" }
                }
            };

        The vertex attribute names provided when creating a shader will be
        used later in sg_create_pipeline() for matching the vertex layout
        to vertex shader inputs.

    --- on D3D11 you need to provide a semantic name and semantic index in the
        shader description struct instead (see the D3D11 documentation on
        D3D11_INPUT_ELEMENT_DESC for details):

            sg_shader_desc desc = {
                .attrs = {
                    [0] = { .sem_name="POSITION", .sem_index=0 }
                    [1] = { .sem_name="COLOR", .sem_index=1 }
                }
            };

        The provided semantic information will be used later in sg_create_pipeline()
        to match the vertex layout to vertex shader inputs.

    --- on D3D11, and when passing HLSL source code (instead of byte code) to shader
        creation, you can optionally define the shader model targets on the vertex
        stage:

            sg_shader_Desc desc = {
                .vs = {
                    ...
                    .d3d11_target = "vs_5_0"
                },
                .fs = {
                    ...
                    .d3d11_target = "ps_5_0"
                }
            };

        The default targets are "ps_4_0" and "fs_4_0". Note that those target names
        are only used when compiling shaders from source. They are ignored when
        creating a shader from bytecode.

    --- on Metal, GL 3.3 or GLES3/WebGL2, you don't need to provide an attribute
        name or semantic name, since vertex attributes can be bound by their slot index
        (this is mandatory in Metal, and optional in GL):

            sg_pipeline_desc desc = {
                .layout = {
                    .attrs = {
                        [0] = { .format=SG_VERTEXFORMAT_FLOAT3 },
                        [1] = { .format=SG_VERTEXFORMAT_FLOAT4 }
                    }
                }
            };

    WORKING WITH CONTEXTS
    =====================
    sokol-gfx allows to switch between different rendering contexts and
    associate resource objects with contexts. This is useful to
    create GL applications that render into multiple windows.

    A rendering context keeps track of all resources created while
    the context is active. When the context is destroyed, all resources
    "belonging to the context" are destroyed as well.

    A default context will be created and activated implicitly in
    sg_setup(), and destroyed in sg_shutdown(). So for a typical application
    which *doesn't* use multiple contexts, nothing changes, and calling
    the context functions isn't necessary.

    Three functions have been added to work with contexts:

    --- sg_context sg_setup_context():
        This must be called once after a GL context has been created and
        made active.

    --- void sg_activate_context(sg_context ctx)
        This must be called after making a different GL context active.
        Apart from 3D-API-specific actions, the call to sg_activate_context()
        will internally call sg_reset_state_cache().

    --- void sg_discard_context(sg_context ctx)
        This must be called right before a GL context is destroyed and
        will destroy all resources associated with the context (that
        have been created while the context was active) The GL context must be
        active at the time sg_discard_context(sg_context ctx) is called.

    Also note that resources (buffers, images, shaders and pipelines) must
    only be used or destroyed while the same GL context is active that
    was also active while the resource was created (an exception is
    resource sharing on GL, such resources can be used while
    another context is active, but must still be destroyed under
    the same context that was active during creation).

    For more information, check out the multiwindow-glfw sample:

    https://github.com/floooh/sokol-samples/blob/master/glfw/multiwindow-glfw.c

    TRACE HOOKS:
    ============
    sokol_gfx.h optionally allows to install "trace hook" callbacks for
    each public API functions. When a public API function is called, and
    a trace hook callback has been installed for this function, the
    callback will be invoked with the parameters and result of the function.
    This is useful for things like debugging- and profiling-tools, or
    keeping track of resource creation and destruction.

    To use the trace hook feature:

    --- Define SOKOL_TRACE_HOOKS before including the implementation.

    --- Setup an sg_trace_hooks structure with your callback function
        pointers (keep all function pointers you're not interested
        in zero-initialized), optionally set the user_data member
        in the sg_trace_hooks struct.

    --- Install the trace hooks by calling sg_install_trace_hooks(),
        the return value of this function is another sg_trace_hooks
        struct which contains the previously set of trace hooks.
        You should keep this struct around, and call those previous
        functions pointers from your own trace callbacks for proper
        chaining.

    As an example of how trace hooks are used, have a look at the
    imgui/sokol_gfx_imgui.h header which implements a realtime
    debugging UI for sokol_gfx.h on top of Dear ImGui.

    A NOTE ON PORTABLE PACKED VERTEX FORMATS:
    =========================================
    There are two things to consider when using packed
    vertex formats like UBYTE4, SHORT2, etc which need to work
    across all backends:

    - D3D11 can only convert *normalized* vertex formats to
      floating point during vertex fetch, normalized formats
      have a trailing 'N', and are "normalized" to a range
      -1.0..+1.0 (for the signed formats) or 0.0..1.0 (for the
      unsigned formats):

        - SG_VERTEXFORMAT_BYTE4N
        - SG_VERTEXFORMAT_UBYTE4N
        - SG_VERTEXFORMAT_SHORT2N
        - SG_VERTEXFORMAT_USHORT2N
        - SG_VERTEXFORMAT_SHORT4N
        - SG_VERTEXFORMAT_USHORT4N

      D3D11 will not convert *non-normalized* vertex formats to floating point
      vertex shader inputs, those can only be uses with the *ivecn* vertex shader
      input types when D3D11 is used as backend (GL and Metal can use both formats)

        - SG_VERTEXFORMAT_BYTE4,
        - SG_VERTEXFORMAT_UBYTE4
        - SG_VERTEXFORMAT_SHORT2
        - SG_VERTEXFORMAT_SHORT4

    - WebGL/GLES2 cannot use integer vertex shader inputs (int or ivecn)

    - SG_VERTEXFORMAT_UINT10_N2 is not supported on WebGL/GLES2

    So for a vertex input layout which works on all platforms, only use the following
    vertex formats, and if needed "expand" the normalized vertex shader
    inputs in the vertex shader by multiplying with 127.0, 255.0, 32767.0 or
    65535.0:

        - SG_VERTEXFORMAT_FLOAT,
        - SG_VERTEXFORMAT_FLOAT2,
        - SG_VERTEXFORMAT_FLOAT3,
        - SG_VERTEXFORMAT_FLOAT4,
        - SG_VERTEXFORMAT_BYTE4N,
        - SG_VERTEXFORMAT_UBYTE4N,
        - SG_VERTEXFORMAT_SHORT2N,
        - SG_VERTEXFORMAT_USHORT2N
        - SG_VERTEXFORMAT_SHORT4N,
        - SG_VERTEXFORMAT_USHORT4N

    Resource id typedefs:

    sg_buffer:      vertex- and index-buffers
    sg_image:       textures and render targets
    sg_shader:      vertex- and fragment-shaders, uniform blocks
    sg_pipeline:    associated shader and vertex-layouts, and render states
    sg_pass:        a bundle of render targets and actions on them
    sg_context:     a 'context handle' for switching between 3D-API contexts

    Instead of pointers, resource creation functions return a 32-bit
    number which uniquely identifies the resource object.

    The 32-bit resource id is split into a 16-bit pool index in the lower bits,
    and a 16-bit 'unique counter' in the upper bits. The index allows fast
    pool lookups, and combined with the unique-mask it allows to detect
    'dangling accesses' (trying to use an object which no longer exists, and
    its pool slot has been reused for a new object)

    The resource ids are wrapped into a struct so that the compiler
    can complain when the wrong resource type is used.

    sg_pixel_format

    sokol_gfx.h basically uses the same pixel formats as WebGPU, since these
    are supported on most newer GPUs. GLES2 and WebGL has a much smaller
    subset of available pixel formats. Call sg_query_pixelformat() to check
    at runtime if a pixel format supports the desired features.

    A pixelformat name consist of three parts:

        - components (R, RG, RGB or RGBA)
        - bit width per component (8, 16 or 32)
        - component data type:
            - unsigned normalized (no postfix)
            - signed normalized (SN postfix)
            - unsigned integer (UI postfix)
            - signed integer (SI postfix)
            - float (F postfix)

    Not all pixel formats can be used for everything, call sg_query_pixelformat()
    to inspect the capabilities of a given pixelformat. The function returns
    an sg_pixelformat_info struct with the following bool members:

        - sample: the pixelformat can be sampled as texture at least with
                  nearest filtering
        - filter: the pixelformat can be samples as texture with linear
                  filtering
        - render: the pixelformat can be used for render targets
        - blend:  blending is supported when using the pixelformat for
                  render targets
        - msaa:   multisample-antiliasing is supported when using the
                  pixelformat for render targets
        - depth:  the pixelformat can be used for depth-stencil attachments

    When targeting GLES2/WebGL, the only safe formats to use
    as texture are SG_PIXELFORMAT_R8 and SG_PIXELFORMAT_RGBA8. For rendering
    in GLES2/WebGL, only SG_PIXELFORMAT_RGBA8 is safe. All other formats
    must be checked via sg_query_pixelformats().

    The default pixel format for texture images is SG_PIXELFORMAT_RGBA8.

    The default pixel format for render target images is platform-dependent:
        - for Metal and D3D11 it is SG_PIXELFORMAT_BGRA8
        - for GL backends it is SG_PIXELFORMAT_RGBA8

    This is mainly because of the default framebuffer which is setup outside
    of sokol_gfx.h. On some backends, using BGRA for the default frame buffer
    allows more efficient frame flips. For your own offscreen-render-targets,
    use whatever renderable pixel format is convenient for you.

    sg_resource_state

    The current state of a resource in its resource pool.
    Resources start in the INITIAL state, which means the
    pool slot is unoccupied and can be allocated. When a resource is
    created, first an id is allocated, and the resource pool slot
    is set to state ALLOC. After allocation, the resource is
    initialized, which may result in the VALID or FAILED state. The
    reason why allocation and initialization are separate is because
    some resource types (e.g. buffers and images) might be asynchronously
    initialized by the user application. If a resource which is not
    in the VALID state is attempted to be used for rendering, rendering
    operations will silently be dropped.

    The special INVALID state is returned in sg_query_xxx_state() if no
    resource object exists for the provided resource id.

    sg_usage

    A resource usage hint describing the update strategy of
    buffers and images. This is used in the sg_buffer_desc.usage
    and sg_image_desc.usage members when creating buffers
    and images:

    SG_USAGE_IMMUTABLE:     the resource will never be updated with
                            new data, instead the data content of the
                            resource must be provided on creation
    SG_USAGE_DYNAMIC:       the resource will be updated infrequently
                            with new data (this could range from "once
                            after creation", to "quite often but not
                            every frame")
    SG_USAGE_STREAM:        the resource will be updated each frame
                            with new content

    The rendering backends use this hint to prevent that the
    CPU needs to wait for the GPU when attempting to update
    a resource that might be currently accessed by the GPU.

    Resource content is updated with the function sg_update_buffer() for
    buffer objects, and sg_update_image() for image objects. Only
    one update is allowed per frame and resource object. The
    application must update all data required for rendering (this
    means that the update data can be smaller than the resource size,
    if only a part of the overall resource size is used for rendering,
    you only need to make sure that the data that *is* used is valid.

    The default usage is SG_USAGE_IMMUTABLE.

    sg_action

    Defines what action should be performed at the start of a render pass:

    SG_ACTION_CLEAR:    clear the render target image
    SG_ACTION_LOAD:     load the previous content of the render target image
    SG_ACTION_DONTCARE: leave the render target image content undefined

    This is used in the sg_pass_action structure.

    The default action for all pass attachments is SG_ACTION_CLEAR, with the
    clear color rgba = {0.5f, 0.5f, 0.5f, 1.0f], depth=1.0 and stencil=0.

    If you want to override the default behaviour, it is important to not
    only set the clear color, but the 'action' field as well (as long as this
    is in its _SG_ACTION_DEFAULT, the value fields will be ignored).

    sg_pass_action

    The sg_pass_action struct defines the actions to be performed
    at the start of a rendering pass in the functions sg_begin_pass()
    and sg_begin_default_pass().

    A separate action and clear values can be defined for each
    color attachment, and for the depth-stencil attachment.

    The default clear values are defined by the macros:

    - SG_DEFAULT_CLEAR_RED:     0.5f
    - SG_DEFAULT_CLEAR_GREEN:   0.5f
    - SG_DEFAULT_CLEAR_BLUE:    0.5f

#rem
    sg_bindings

    The sg_bindings structure defines the resource binding slots
    of the sokol_gfx render pipeline, used as argument to the
    sg_apply_bindings() function.

    A resource binding struct contains:

    - 1..N vertex buffers
    - 0..N vertex buffer offsets
    - 0..1 index buffers
    - 0..1 index buffer offsets
    - 0..N vertex shader stage images
    - 0..N fragment shader stage images

    The max number of vertex buffer and shader stage images
    are defined by the SG_MAX_SHADERSTAGE_BUFFERS and
    SG_MAX_SHADERSTAGE_IMAGES configuration constants.

    The optional buffer offsets can be used to group different chunks
    of vertex- and/or index-data into the same buffer objects.

#rem
    sg_buffer_desc

    Creation parameters for sg_buffer objects, used in the
    sg_make_buffer() call.

    The default configuration is:

    .size:      0       (this *must* be set to a valid size in bytes)
    .type:      SG_BUFFERTYPE_VERTEXBUFFER
    .usage:     SG_USAGE_IMMUTABLE
    .content    0
    .label      0       (optional string label for trace hooks)

    The dbg_label will be ignored by sokol_gfx.h, it is only useful
    when hooking into sg_make_buffer() or sg_init_buffer() via
    the sg_install_trace_hook

    ADVANCED TOPIC: Injecting native 3D-API buffers:

    The following struct members allow to inject your own GL, Metal
    or D3D11 buffers into sokol_gfx:

    .gl_buffers[SG_NUM_INFLIGHT_FRAMES]
    .mtl_buffers[SG_NUM_INFLIGHT_FRAMES]
    .d3d11_buffer

    You must still provide all other members except the .content member, and
    these must match the creation parameters of the native buffers you
    provide. For SG_USAGE_IMMUTABLE, only provide a single native 3D-API
    buffer, otherwise you need to provide SG_NUM_INFLIGHT_FRAMES buffers
    (only for GL and Metal, not D3D11). Providing multiple buffers for GL and
    Metal is necessary because sokol_gfx will rotate through them when
    calling sg_update_buffer() to prevent lock-stalls.

    Note that it is expected that immutable injected buffer have already been
    initialized with content, and the .content member must be 0!

    Also you need to call sg_reset_state_cache() after calling native 3D-API
    functions, and before calling any sokol_gfx function.

    sg_subimage_content

    Pointer to and size of a subimage-surface data, this is

    or for updating a dynamic- or stream-usage images.

    For 3D- or array-textures, one sg_subimage_content item
    describes an entire mipmap level consisting of all array- or

    .content            an sg_image_content struct to define the initial content
    .label              0       (optional string label for trace hooks)

    SG_IMAGETYPE_ARRAY and SG_IMAGETYPE_3D are not supported on
    WebGL/GLES2, use sg_query_features().imagetype_array and
    sg_query_features().imagetype_3d at runtime to check
    if array- and 3D-textures are supported.

    Images with usage SG_USAGE_IMMUTABLE must be fully initialized by
    providing a valid .content member which points to
    initialization data.

    ADVANCED TOPIC: Injecting native 3D-API textures:

    sg_shader_desc

    The structure sg_shader_desc defines all creation parameters

    - reflection information for vertex attributes (vertex shader inputs):
        - vertex attribute name (required for GLES2, optional for GLES3 and GL)
        - a semantic name and index (required for D3D11)
    - for each vertex- and fragment-shader-stage:
        - the shader source or bytecode
        - an optional entry function name
        - reflection info for each uniform block used by the shader stage:
            - the size of the uniform block in bytes
            - reflection info for each uniform block member (only required for GL backends):
                - member name
                - member type (SG_UNIFORMTYPE_xxx)
                - if the member is an array, the number of array items
        - reflection info for the texture images used by the shader stage:
            - the image type (SG_IMAGETYPE_xxx)
            - the name of the texture sampler (required for GLES2, optional everywhere else)

    For all GL backends, shader source-code must be provided. For D3D11 and Metal,
    either shader source-code or byte-code can be provided.

    For D3D11, if source code is provided, the d3dcompiler_47.dll will be loaded
    on demand. If this fails, shader creation will fail.

    sg_pipeline_desc

    The sg_pipeline_desc struct defines all creation parameters
    for an sg_pipeline object, used as argument to the
    sg_make_pipeline() function:

    - the vertex layout for all input vertex buffers
    - a shader object
    - the 3D primitive type (points, lines, triangles, ...)
    - the index type (none, 16- or 32-bit)
    - depth-stencil state
    - alpha-blending state
    - rasterizer state

    If the vertex data has no gaps between vertex components, you can omit
    the .layout.buffers[].stride and layout.attrs[].offset items (leave them
    default-initialized to 0), sokol will then compute the offsets and strides
    from the vertex component formats (.layout.attrs[].offset). Please note
    that ALL vertex attribute offsets must be 0 in order for the the
    automatic offset computation to kick in.

    The default configuration is as follows:

    .layout:
        .buffers[]:         vertex buffer layouts
            .stride:        0 (if no stride is given it will be computed)

    sg_pass_desc

    Creation parameters for an sg_pass object, used as argument
    to the sg_make_pass() function.

    A pass object contains 1..4 color-attachments and none, or one,
    depth-stencil-attachment. Each attachment consists of
    an image, and two additional indices describing
    which subimage the pass will render: one mipmap index, and
    if the image is a cubemap, array-texture or 3D-texture, the
    face-index, array-layer or depth-slice.

    Pass images must fulfill the following requirements:

    All images must have:
    - been created as render target (sg_image_desc.render_target = true)
    - the same size
    - the same sample count

    In addition, all color-attachment images must have the same
    pixel format.

    sg_desc

    The sg_desc struct contains configuration values for sokol_gfx,
    it is used as parameter to the sg_setup() call.

    NOTE that all callback function pointers come in two versions, one without
    a userdata pointer, and one with a userdata pointer. You would
    either initialize one or the other depending on whether you pass data
    to your callbacks.

    FIXME: explain the various configuration options

    The default configuration is:

    .buffer_pool_size       128
    .image_pool_size        128
    .shader_pool_size       32
    .pipeline_pool_size     64
    .pass_pool_size         16
    .context_pool_size      16
    .sampler_cache_size     64
    .uniform_buffer_size    4 MB (4*1024*1024)
    .staging_buffer_size    8 MB (8*1024*1024)

    .context.color_format: default value depends on selected backend:
        all GL backends:    SG_PIXELFORMAT_RGBA8
        Metal and D3D11:    SG_PIXELFORMAT_BGRA8
        WGPU:               *no default* (must be queried from WGPU swapchain)
    .context.depth_format   SG_PIXELFORMAT_DEPTH_STENCIL
    .context.sample_count   1

    GL specific:
        .context.gl.force_gles2
            if this is true the GL backend will act in "GLES2 fallback mode" even
            when compiled with SOKOL_GLES3, this is useful to fall back
            to traditional WebGL if a browser doesn't support a WebGL2 context

    Metal specific:
        (NOTE: All Objective-C object references are transferred through
        a bridged (const void*) to sokol_gfx, which will use a unretained
        bridged cast (__bridged id<xxx>) to retrieve the Objective-C
        references back. Since the bridge cast is unretained, the caller
        must hold a strong reference to the Objective-C object for the
        duration of the sokol_gfx call!

        .context.metal.device
            a pointer to the MTLDevice object
        .context.metal.renderpass_descriptor_cb
        .context.metal_renderpass_descriptor_userdata_cb
            A C callback function to obtain the MTLRenderPassDescriptor for the
            current frame when rendering to the default framebuffer, will be called
            in sg_begin_default_pass().
        .context.metal.drawable_cb
        .context.metal.drawable_userdata_cb
            a C callback function to obtain a MTLDrawable for the current
            frame when rendering to the default framebuffer, will be called in
            sg_end_pass() of the default pass
        .context.metal.user_data
            optional user data pointer passed to the userdata versions of
            callback functions

    D3D11 specific:
        .context.d3d11.device
            a pointer to the ID3D11Device object, this must have been created
            before sg_setup() is called
        .context.d3d11.device_context
            a pointer to the ID3D11DeviceContext object
        .context.d3d11.render_target_view_cb
        .context.d3d11.render_target_view_userdata_cb
            a C callback function to obtain a pointer to the current
            ID3D11RenderTargetView object of the default framebuffer,
            this function will be called in sg_begin_pass() when rendering
            to the default framebuffer
        .context.d3d11.depth_stencil_view_cb
        .context.d3d11.depth_stencil_view_userdata_cb
            a C callback function to obtain a pointer to the current
            ID3D11DepthStencilView object of the default framebuffer,
            this function will be called in sg_begin_pass() when rendering
            to the default framebuffer
        .context.metal.user_data
            optional user data pointer passed to the userdata versions of
            callback functions

    WebGPU specific:
        .context.wgpu.device
            a WGPUDevice handle
        .context.wgpu.render_format
            WGPUTextureFormat of the swap chain surface
        .context.wgpu.render_view_cb
        .context.wgpu.render_view_userdata_cb
            callback to get the current WGPUTextureView of the swapchain's
            rendering attachment (may be an MSAA surface)
        .context.wgpu.resolve_view_cb
        .context.wgpu.resolve_view_userdata_cb
            callback to get the current WGPUTextureView of the swapchain's
            MSAA-resolve-target surface, must return 0 if not MSAA rendering
        .context.wgpu.depth_stencil_view_cb
        .context.wgpu.depth_stencil_view_userdata_cb
            callback to get current default-pass depth-stencil-surface WGPUTextureView
            the pixel format of the default WGPUTextureView must be WGPUTextureFormat_Depth24Plus8
        .context.metal.user_data
            optional user data pointer passed to the userdata versions of
            callback functions

    When using sokol_gfx.h and sokol_app.h together, consider using the
    helper function sapp_sgcontext() in the sokol_glue.h header to
    initialize the sg_desc.context nested struct. sapp_sgcontext() returns
    a completely initialized sg_context_desc struct with information
    provided by sokol_app.h.
